This projects is my first project exam. 

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design and develop a modern, accessible, and responsive web presence for the Community Science Museum, targeting primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. This project is part of Noroff's first-year Frontend development full-time online course (FED1).

# Description
This project is a front-end website for the fictional Community Science Museum. Built entirely with HTML and CSS (without using frameworks or JavaScript), the site aims to excite and engage a younger audience without being overly childish, offering a clean and engaging user experience across various devices.

### Key features include:
- Home Page: Presents impactful imagery and key information about the museum.
- Contact Page: Displays the museum's address, phone number, opening hours, and a contact form.
- Contribution Page: Provides information on how visitors can contribute to the museum.
- Exhibitions Page: Shows upcoming events and available exhibitions.
- Privacy Policy and Terms Pages: Includes privacy policy and terms & conditions, either combined or on separate pages.

### Learning Outcomes
Throughout the development of this application, I have demonstrated the following skills:

- Planning and designing a responsive, user-friendly website.
- Implementing semantic HTML and adhering to the CSS DRY principle.
- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and accessibility for a broad range of users.
- Optimizing images for web delivery and ensuring that the design is responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- Testing the website for compliance with web standards and accessibility guidelines.

### Client and Target Audience
The client, Community Science Museum, is an interactive science museum aimed at school children and families. The website is designed to appeal to children ages 7-15, providing them with an engaging, educational experience without being overly simplistic.
